## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Kakomanato/Kakomanato** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Welcome! I'm starting on the journey of software development full of enthusiasm and ideas, some of which I hope I can share with you soon 😄.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a website about a voting system for random (or not so random if you choose different options) matchup generation between different characters from the One Piece franchise. It's up to you to decide who wins. The characters with more votes will rise higher in the ranking of power!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Firebase.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Game Development.
